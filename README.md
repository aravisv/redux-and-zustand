1. created react app using parcel's recipe
2. header, body and motivation card components
3. basic HTML form accepting userName. JS event listeners and validations

6. using reduxjs/toolkit - createSlice instead of the legacy way to create reducer
   and configureStore to create store

9. using persist from zustand middleware to persist data during page refresh
10. using session storage via handling the JSON parsing manually and using the createJSONStorage method
