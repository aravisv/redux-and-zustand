1. created react app using parcel's recipe
2. header, body and motivation card components
3. basic HTML form accepting userName. JS event listeners and validations
4. useRef to get the form value.
5. used redux and react-redux to maintain appStore. just storing userName
6. using reduxjs/toolkit - createSlice instead of the legacy way to create reducer
   and configureStore to create store
7. using zustand instead of redux
